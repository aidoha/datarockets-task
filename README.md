## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) - is a popular command-line tool and development environment that provides a pre-configured setup for creating React applications with modern tooling and best practices.
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### Continued development

In order to get this project scalable we might use third party libraries for state management as [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)

### Useful resources

- [typescript: usereducer revisited](https://stephenweiss.dev/typescript-use-reducer-revisited) - This helped me for typing those pieces of code that are related to useReducer.
- [useCallback](https://dmitripavlutin.com/react-usecallback/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand when it's not recommended to use useCallback. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning hooks.
